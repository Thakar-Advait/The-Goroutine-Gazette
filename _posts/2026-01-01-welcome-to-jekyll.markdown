This blog is a place where I, Advait Thakar, share my journey learning Go and exploring its concurrency features like goroutines and channels. I'm just starting out, and through these posts, I document experiments, tutorials, and insights as I grow my knowledge and skills.

Here, you'll find explanations, code snippets, and reflections on what I'm learning. The goal is not to be an expert resource, but to share the journey, the discoveries, and the questions that come up along the way.

### Why This Blog Exists

I started this blog to keep track of my learning process in Go, concurrency, and other computer engineering topics. Writing posts helps me understand concepts better, and hopefully, it helps others who are also learning or curious about these subjects.

### What to Expect

- **Experiments:** Trying out Go features like goroutines, channels, and concurrency patterns.
- **Code snippets:** Small examples to illustrate concepts I'm learning.
- **Reflections:** Notes on challenges, insights, and things I discover while learning.

Think of this as an ongoing diary of a learner's journey in Go, one goroutine at a time. Your feedback and comments are welcome, and together we can explore Go and programming concepts in a practical, hands-on way.

**Next Steps:** Check out the latest posts in the `_posts/` section to see my experiments and tutorials.
